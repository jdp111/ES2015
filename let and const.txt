1. var is an older variable type, and its scope is wider than block. let does not allow reassignment, and the scope is in the block only.
2. var allows you to redeclare and reassign, const does not allow you to redeclare or reassign. const is block scope, while var is wider scope.
3. const is not allowed to be reassigned, while let allows reassignment
4. when an object is declared, the declaration can be identified in the code before it is assigned, thus a variable that is declared anywhere in the code is initialized first as 'undefiined'.
